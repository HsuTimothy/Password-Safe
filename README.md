# Password-Safe

An app built in `Objective C` to simplify my life by storing important account information. The app's purpose is to intake a program name, username for that program, and the password to the account.

To access the app, you are required to enter your touch ID to pass the initial authentication screen. The reason why I chose to go with a touch ID was because I felt that requiring a password to *access* a password-storing app defeats the purpose of the app. Thus, I decided to utilize the touch ID authentication method because of its simplicity.

*Example data:*
* Program: LinkedIn
* Username: username123@email.com
* Password: securePassword123

To add a new set of account information, press the `+` button in the top right. To delete a set of account information, swipe left on the specific row and select `DELETE`.
